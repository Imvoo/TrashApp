# TrashApp

### Third Place Winner of Codebrew 2018

An app that tries to tackle the issue of waste management by incentivizing picking up and recycling rubbish. This was created in response to the underlying theme "A Developing World" for Codebrew 2018.

This app was written in 30 hours in React Native by team Binevolent. It was bootstrapped using [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Requirements
The server component must also be running to retrieve live information in the application. The server can be found here: [https://github.com/codebrew-trash/TrashServer](https://github.com/codebrew-trash/TrashServer).

## Setup

- Run `npm install` in the directory to install the dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to start the application.
  - Note that you need an Android or iOS device connected to test the application itself. The live demo runs on the `Expo` application for live debugging.
  - Alternatively, you can use Genymotion or a native Android/iOS simulator on your PC if you do not have a physical device.
